What is a Virtual Environment?
A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python interpreter and packages specific to a particular project. It isolates your project’s dependencies from the system-wide Python environment, avoiding version conflicts and helping to manage packages cleanly.

Why Use a Virtual Environment?
Avoid conflicts between dependencies across projects.

Maintain cleaner, more manageable development environments.

Easily recreate the environment using a requirements.txt file.

🔹 How to Create and Use a Virtual Environment

1. Create a Virtual Environment
   Using venv (built-in): python -m venv myenv

2.✅ Activate the Virtual Environment
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

Once activated, your terminal will show the environment name like:

(myenv) $

3. Install Packages Inside Virtual Env
   pip install <package-name>
   Example: pip install requests

4. Save Installed Packages
   To save your project dependencies: pip freeze > requirements.txt
   To install them later on another system: pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
   When done working: deactivate

🔹 What is django-admin?
django-admin is a command-line tool provided by Django to help you interact with and manage Django projects. It can be used to create projects, run development servers, manage databases, and more.

🔧 Where Does It Come From?
It’s automatically installed when you install Django:

pip install django

first command : django-admin startproject projectName

used to start or initialize the project

sqlite3 default database used in django

settings.py -> whole configuration of your project is written here

urls.py-> routing file -> means where you can go (on which urls basically)

views.py-> means it defines all your controllers or functionality

models.py-> stores all your database or models

{% load static %}
Purpose: Tells Django to enable the {% static %} template tag.

Use: You need this at the top whenever you're using static files (CSS, JS, images).

Django uses this tag to locate and serve static files during development.

in setting.py
STATIC_URL = 'static/'
✅ What it means:
This sets the base URL for serving static files in development.

So when you use:

django

{% static 'myfile.css' %}
Django will generate:

<link href="/static/myfile.css">
You’ll use this in development to tell Django:
“Serve all static files from the /static/ path in the browser.”

🔹 2. STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'styles')]
✅ What it means:
This tells Django:

“In addition to app-level static/ folders, also look inside the styles/ folder (in the project root) for static files.”

🔍 Details:
BASE_DIR is the root directory of your Django project.

os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'styles') evaluates to something like:

/home/user/myproject/styles
So if you have:

myproject/
├── styles/
│ └── style.css
Then you can use:

django

{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'style.css' %}" />
Even though the file is in the styles/ folder, Django will serve it at:

bash

http://localhost:8000/static/style.css
✅ Why use STATICFILES_DIRS?
Because by default, Django only looks for static files in:

Each app's static/ folder.

So if you want to keep static files outside your apps, like in a global styles/ or assets/ folder, you must add that folder here.

💡 Summary
Setting Purpose
STATIC_URL URL prefix for serving static files (/static/)
STATICFILES_DIRS Extra folders (outside apps) where Django will look for static files

# after creating a app it is important to aware the main project that a new project is created

✅ Step-by-Step: Create a Django App
🔹 Step 1: Navigate to Your Django Project
Make sure you are inside the project folder (where manage.py exists):

bash

cd myproject
🔹 Step 2: Run the startapp Command
bash

python manage.py startapp myapp
This creates a new folder myapp/ with the following structure:

markdown

myapp/
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
├── views.py
├── migrations/
└── **init**.py
🔹 Step 3: Register the App in settings.py
Open: myproject/settings.py
Find the INSTALLED_APPS list and add your app name:

python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
...
'myapp',
]

Jinja (or "Django Template Language"):
Jinja is a popular templating engine originally made for Flask (another web framework).

Django has its own similar template engine — but very close to Jinja in syntax.

🔧 Example Syntax (Jinja or Django Templates):
django
Copy
Edit
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
  <p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Please log in.</p>
{% endif %}
{% %}: Template logic (if, for, load static, etc.)

{{ }}: Variable output




🔹 2. What is startapp in Django?
✅ Purpose:
startapp is a command used to create a new app (module) inside your Django project.

An app is a component of your project that handles one particular feature (e.g., blog, user login, chat, etc.).

🔧 Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py startapp myapp
📁 It creates:
bash
Copy
Edit
myapp/
├── admin.py         # For Django admin integration
├── apps.py          # App config
├── models.py        # Database models
├── views.py         # Business logic (functions/classes that return web pages)
├── urls.py          # (You usually create this) — for app-specific routes
├── migrations/      # DB change trackers
└── __init__.py



🔹 What Are Migrations in Django?
Migrations are Django’s way of tracking changes in your database schema (like creating or modifying tables) based on the models you define in your Python code.

🔧 In simple words:
Migrations are instructions for Django on how to create/update/delete database tables according to your models.py.

✅ Example
Suppose you write this model:

python
Copy
Edit
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
To apply it to your database, you do:

Create migration files (like a plan):

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py makemigrations
Apply those changes to the DB:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
✅ Now a Book table is created in your database!

📁 What Do Migrations Look Like?
They are Python files stored in your app’s migrations/ folder, like:

Copy
Edit
0001_initial.py
0002_add_field_author.py
Each file tells Django:

“Create this table” or “Add this column” or “Remove this field,” etc.

🔄 Workflow Summary
Step	Command	Purpose
1️⃣	Modify models.py	Add/change/remove model fields
2️⃣	python manage.py makemigrations	Generate migration files
3️⃣	python manage.py migrate	Apply changes to the actual database

✅ Useful Migration Commands
Command	Use
makemigrations	Create migration files from model changes
migrate	Apply migrations to the database
showmigrations	List all migrations and their applied status
sqlmigrate appname migration_number	See the raw SQL for a migration
python manage.py migrate app zero	Rollback all migrations for an app

💡 Why Use Migrations?
You don’t have to write SQL manually.

Keeps track of every change you make to your database.

Easy to apply or roll back changes.

Useful in team projects and version control.

Let me know if you want to try creating a sample model and running its migrations!







python manage.py createsuperuser
The createsuperuser command is used to create an admin user (superuser) who can log in to Django’s built-in admin panel and manage your site’s data.

✅ What Is a Superuser?
A superuser is:

An administrator

Has full permissions

Can add, edit, delete any data

Can create other users or superusers

✅ How to Use It
Make sure you’re inside your Django project folder (where manage.py is), and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py createsuperuser
You'll be prompted to enter:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Username: admin
Email address: admin@example.com
Password:
Password (again):
If successful, you'll see:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Superuser created successfully.
🔸 Note: You must have run migrate first
Before creating a superuser, make sure the database is ready:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
🖥️ Using the Admin Panel
After creating a superuser:

Run the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
Go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Log in using the credentials you just created.




Relationship Models 

1. One to Many->  left has one entity and right has many entities


In a database, "cascade" refers to an automatic propagation of changes (like delete, update, or insert) from one table to another based on relationships — typically foreign key constraints.

🧠 Common Types of Cascade Actions:
ON DELETE CASCADE

If a parent row is deleted, all related child rows are automatically deleted.

Example: Deleting a user also deletes all their posts.

ON UPDATE CASCADE

If the primary key in the parent table is updated, the foreign keys in the child table are automatically updated.

Useful if the primary key (e.g., user ID) can change.

🔗 Example in SQL:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
In this example, if a user is deleted from the users table, all their posts in the posts table are automatically deleted.

✅ Benefits:
Maintains referential integrity

Reduces boilerplate logic in application code

Prevents orphan records (child rows without a valid parent)




Feature	auto_now_add=True	default=timezone.now
Timezone Support	✅ Yes (uses timezone.now() internally)	✅ Yes (you explicitly call timezone.now)
Value Set On	Object creation only	Object creation (or manually overridden)
Manual Override	❌ No — read-only	✅ Yes — flexible
Editable in Forms/Admin	❌ No	✅ Yes
Good for	Strict, auto-generated timestamps	Customizable timestamps
Updates After Creation	❌ Never	✅ If you allow it








2. Many to Many relationship-> one chai can be present on many stores and many chais can be present on one store



3 one to one relationship-> every field is asociatod to only one relationship



file structure of a django project: 
1. manage.py->

2. project folder(inside the project you created )-> for example my-site

3. my-site/__init__.py

4.my-site/settings.py

5.my-site/urls.py

6.my-site/asgi.py

Python Json 
Python has a built in package called json which is used to work with json data(value="") 

dumps(data) - this is used to convert python object into json string


Serializers
what are serializers?
in DRF , serializers are responsible for converting complex data such as querysets and model instances to native Python datatypes (called serialization) that can then be easily rendered into JSON,XML or other content types which is esily understandable by frontend

Serializers are also responsibel for deserializtion which means it allows parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data

Serializer Class


what is de-serialization

de-serialization allows parsed data to be converted back into complex data types , after first validating the incoming data type
